# Visible Values

Given a binary tree return all the values you’d be able to see if you were standing on the left side of it with values ordered from top to bottom.

Ex: Given the following tree…

```
-->    4
      / \
-->  2   7
return [4, 2]
```

Ex: Given the following tree…

```
-->        7
         /  \
-->     4     9
       / \   / \
-->   1   4 8   9
                 \
-->               9
return [7, 4, 1, 9]
```
